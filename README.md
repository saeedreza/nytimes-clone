# Timeslide

NY Times RSS reader meets TikTok.

Timeslide reimagines how we consume news by combining the New York Times' journalistic excellence with TikTok's engaging vertical scroll format. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## Features

- 📰 Vertical scrolling news feed
- 👆 Swipe navigation between articles
- 🌗 Dark mode support
- 📱 Mobile-first design
- 🔍 Category-based navigation

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## How It Works

Timeslide transforms traditional news articles into bite-sized, visually engaging content. Each article is presented in a full-screen format, allowing users to immerse themselves in the story through a combination of text, images, and videos. Navigation is intuitive - simply swipe up or down to move between articles.

The app categorizes news into different sections (World, Politics, Technology, etc.), accessible through the side menu. Users can interact with content through comments, shares, and bookmarks, creating a more engaging news consumption experience.

## Development

This project was developed using AI tools, including [Onlook](https://onlook.com/) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), powered by the Claude and GPT-4 models.
