## How It Works

NewsTok transforms traditional news articles into bite-sized, visually engaging content. Each article is presented in a full-screen format, allowing users to immerse themselves in the story through a combination of text, images, and videos. Navigation is intuitive - simply swipe up or down to move between articles.

The app categorizes news into different sections (World, Politics, Technology, etc.), accessible through the side menu. Users can interact with content through comments, shares, and bookmarks, creating a more engaging news consumption experience.
